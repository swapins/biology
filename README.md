## Introduction
BIOLOGY is a web application developed using Laravel 9 that combines the power of bioinformatics with various computational techniques to analyze and interpret biological data. This application aims to provide researchers and scientists with essential tools and features to perform common bioinformatics tasks efficiently.

## Features
- Sequence Alignment: Align DNA, RNA, or protein sequences to identify regions of similarity.
- Genome Assembly: Assemble short DNA sequence reads into longer contiguous sequences to reconstruct genomes.
- Gene Prediction: Identify genes within genomic sequences and predict their locations and functions.
- Protein Structure Prediction: Predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins from their amino acid sequences.
- Sequence Database Searching: Search NCBI's GenBank or UniProt for sequences with similar or related sequences.
- Phylogenetic Analysis: Reconstruct evolutionary relationships among organisms using molecular data to build phylogenetic trees.
- Gene Expression Analysis: Analyze gene expression data from microarrays or RNA sequencing to study patterns and regulation of gene expression.
- Variant Calling: Identify genetic variations, such as SNPs, insertions, deletions, or structural variants, in DNA sequences.
- Functional Annotation: Assign functional information to genes or proteins by comparing them to known databases or using functional prediction algorithms.
- Data Visualization: Visualize and present biological data using graphs, charts, heatmaps, or other visual representations.
- Pathway and Network Analysis: Analyze molecular interaction networks or metabolic pathways to understand the functional relationships and dynamics of biological systems.
- Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical methods to analyze and interpret biological data.
